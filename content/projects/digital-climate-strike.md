To spread the word about the wordwide ClimateStrike in September 2019, I contributed to the frontend build of a small, but powerful, banner. On September 20th, expand the banner expanded fullscreen so that websites could digitally join the strike. With a reach of over 1.5 million, and 2,000 participating web sites, I was proud to be a small part of a big movement.
